#
# About
#
#  This program copies a bunch of memory about, then jumps to it.
#
#
# Usage
#
#  $ compiler ./memcpy.in ; ./simple-vm ./memcpy.raw
#
#
#

        goto run
    :code

        #
        #  This is the code we're going to copy and execute.
        #
        store #1, "Steve Kemp\n"
        print_str #1
        exit

    :run
        #
        # Copy the code to 0x5000 - NOTE The length is a guess here.
        # if we could support "store #1, run-code" that would be neat.
        #
        store #1, 0x5000
        store #2, code
        store #3, 50
        memcpy #1, #2, #3

        #
        # Jump there.
        #
        goto 0x5000
